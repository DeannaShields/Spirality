# Spirality
MATLAB code to measure the pitch angle of spiral galaxies in FITS images by fitting them to spiral templates of known pitch.  The Spirality code package also includes GenSpiral, which produces FITS images of synthetic spirals, and Spi- ralArmCount, which uses a one-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform to count the spiral arms of a galaxy after its pitch is determined.
